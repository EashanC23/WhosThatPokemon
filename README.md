# Whos that Pokemon

---

The idea of this react app is to recreate the classic Pokémon game Whos That Pokémon? as seen in the Pokémon anime.
I also mainly used this as a project to practice my react and web dev skills.

to run this on your own machine run the following commands: 
```
git clone https://github.com/EashanC23/WhosThatPokemon
cd WhosThatPokemon
npm install
```
then run the dev or the build ( idk the difference if anyone wants to explain leave a message in the issues ) run dev 
running dev 
`` npm run dev``
running build 
``` 
npm run build 
npm run preview 
``` 
Short-term todos:
- Css 
- Modal for alerts as opposed to alerts
- Hard vs Easy mode
